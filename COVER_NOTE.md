# Promage - UX-Driven Project Management Dashboard

## Project Overview

**Promage** is a modern project management dashboard that demonstrates comprehensive implementation of UX design laws and micro-interactions. Built with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS, this application showcases how psychological principles can create intuitive, efficient user experiences.

## Phase Implementation

### Phase 1: Core UX Laws
Implemented **10 fundamental UX laws** throughout the application:
- **Fitts's Law**: Large touch targets (44-48px), strategic positioning
- **Hick's Law**: Limited navigation options, progressive disclosure
- **Miller's Law**: Information chunked into 5-9 items
- **Jakob's Law**: Familiar patterns (sidebar, dropdowns, color conventions)
- **Gestalt Principles**: Visual grouping, common regions, uniform connectedness
- **Serial Position Effect**: Key actions positioned first/last
- **Aesthetic-Usability Effect**: Smooth animations, consistent design system
- **Tesler's Law**: Complexity managed automatically

### Phase 2: Micro-Interactions
Implemented **40+ thoughtful micro-interactions**:
- Hover states with 150-300ms transitions
- Button scale animations (1.03x hover, 0.98x active)
- Dropdown chevron rotations and fade-ins
- SVG-based progress visualizations
- Mobile slide menu with backdrop overlay
- Status color coding and empty states
- Focus rings and accessibility features

## Documentation

- **README.md**: Setup guide, UX law explanations, design decisions
- **PHASE_NOTES.md**: Detailed micro-interaction mapping with code examples
- **Fully responsive**: Mobile-first design with touch-optimized interactions

**Result**: A production-ready dashboard demonstrating the powerful intersection of psychology, design, and technology.
